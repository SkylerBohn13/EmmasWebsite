<h1 align: center>Purpose for the Concerto Pro app:</h1>

<p>All around the world there are many, many young pianists that are struggling with the same problem that I have been, the problem of having to practice concertos with a second piano.</p>

<p>My app concerto pro fixes this problem by providing piano players like me, with a second piano to practice with! Concerto pro not only functions as a double for the second piano but can also double for the first piano to make practice more simple.</p>

<p>Concerto Pro is now published in both the app store and google play. I also created the app face design myself starting with a draft on paper and then importing it on to adobe to create the final result!</p>
